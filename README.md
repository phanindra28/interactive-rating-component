## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite - Project Setup


### What I learned

This challenge gave me a good exposure on styling. I have learned how to use background images for applying fading background.
Also, I've used Vite for the first time to set up the project. It is a great tool for setting up react projects. It is very fast and easy to use.
It was a new learning on how to deploy vite app to GitHub pages.
